# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Algorithm-in-c
The Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher.
